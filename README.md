# Description:

"This dataset contains traffic violation information from all electronic traffic violations issued in the Montgomery County of Maryland. Any information that can be used to uniquely identify the vehicle, the vehicle owner or the officer issuing the violation will not be published."

# Questions to Keep in Mine:
How does location affect the concentration of crashes and traffic violations? 
How do the time of day and time of year affect the number of traffic violations and crashes? 
How does the car color affect its likelihood of being pulled over, and is it true that red cars are more likely to be pulled over? 
How does gender affect the likelihood of receiving a warning or a ticket for a traffic violation?

# Answers
It was discovered through use of clustering and heatmaps that environmental factors that have the greatest influence on the density of crashes and citations were nearby buildings and businesses. For example, a high amount of crashes occurred around the most popular bar in the county as well as around a major city center. it was found that the frequency of crashes over a 24-hour-period peaks around rush hour and reaches a minimum at 5:00 A.M, while the frequency of all traffic violations peaks at midnight and also reaches a minimum at 5:00 A.M. For the car color, it was found that the percentage of red cars pulled over matched very closely with the average percentage of red cars owned. White and brown cars were less commonly pulled over while green, blue, gold/yellow, and other less common colors were more likely to be stopped. When comparing the percentage of citations received to total number of warnings and tickets combined, men received tickets 54% of the time while women only received tickets 43% of the time.


# Application of Findings
Dip in average traffic violations in 2015. Shows that the data should be analyzed for explanations of this pattern and successful policies.

With the traffic location data, City workers can see which environmental/road factors may contribute to a higher number of crashes and violations. Police officers can also increase the amount of time they patrol in those areas.

Accidents tend to occur more in the winter and during commute times, so the police force can be ready by having more accident investigators on hand in the winter and during rush hour.

Since there was a noticeable difference between the percentage of citations vs warnings received by men and by women, police officers could be penalized for being biased. This will also help prevent women from being taken advantage of by police officers.
