# Description:

"This dataset contains traffic violation information from all electronic traffic violations issued in the Montgomery County of Maryland. Any information that can be used to uniquely identify the vehicle, the vehicle owner or the officer issuing the violation will not be published."

# Questions to Keep in Mine:
What are the top five streets for issuing traffic citations?

What cars are most likely to commit trafiic violations in this county?

Are there certain times of the year/day that crashes are more likely to occur?

How does the percentage of traffic violations issued based on ethnicity compare with the demographic distribution of the county?

# Application of Findings
Dip in average traffic violations in 2015. Shows that the data should be analyzed for explanations of this pattern and successful policies.

Highest traffic violation concentration on top of a map. City workers can see what environmental/road factors may contribute to the higher number of violations.

Personal injury accident occur more in the winter than the summer, so the police force can be ready by having more accident investigators on hand in the winter.
